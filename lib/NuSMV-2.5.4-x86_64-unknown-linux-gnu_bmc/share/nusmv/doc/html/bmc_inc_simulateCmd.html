<h3>bmc_inc_simulate - Incrementally generates a trace of the model performing a given number of steps.</h3>
<hr>
<code>bmc_inc_simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t "constraints"]</code><p>
bmc_inc_simulate performs incremental simulation
  of the model. If no length is specified with <i>-k</i> command
  parameter, then the number of steps of simulation to perform is
  taken from the value stored in the environment variable
  <i>bmc_length</i>.<BR>
  Command Options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-p</tt>
       <dd> Prints current generated trace (only those variables whose value
       changed from the previous state).
    <dt> <tt>-v</tt>
       <dd> Verbosely prints current generated trace (changed and unchanged
       state variables).
    <dt> <tt>-r</tt>
       <dd> Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random way.
    <dt> <tt>-i</tt>
       <dd> Enters simulation's interactive mode.
    <dt> <tt>-a</tt>
       <dd> Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged)
            in the interactive session
    <dt> <tt>-c "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted
       to states satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired
       sequence of states could not exist if such constraints were too
       strong or it may happen that at some point of the simulation a
       future state satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in
       that case a trace with a number of states less than
       <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained. The expression cannot contain
       next operators, and is automatically shifted by one state in
       order to constraint only the next steps
    <dt> <tt>-t "constraints"</tt>
       <dd> Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted
       to states satisfying those <tt>constraints</tt>. The desired
       sequence of states could not exist if such constraints were too
       strong or it may happen that at some point of the simulation a
       future state satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in
       that case a trace with a number of states less than
       <tt>steps</tt> trace is obtained.  The expression can contain
       next operators, and is NOT automatically shifted by one state
       as done with option -c
    <dt> <tt>-k steps</tt>
       <dd> Maximum length of the path according to the constraints.
       The length of a trace could contain less than <tt>steps</tt> states:
       this is the case in which simulation stops in an intermediate
       step because it may not exist any future state satisfying those
       constraints.
