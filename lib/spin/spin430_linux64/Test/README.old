-- Updated for SPIN Version 3.1 ---

Perform tests test0 to test5 in the order listed, and
make sure you get the same results.
The next four tests are to assess the effect of
partial order reductions.  In exhaustive mode, they
may not all be executable within the bounds of your
system - with reduction turned on, though, they should
all run as specified.
The last test checks the use of execution priorities
during random simulations.

The file called 'pathfinder' illustrates the use of
'provided' clauses (using as inspiration the bug in
the control software of the Mars pathfinder that
spotted an otherwise perfect mission in July 1997)

	You can always check valid options of spin
	by typing: spin --

	Similarly, you can check valid options of
	the compiled verifiers by typing: pan --

test 0	check that spin exists and is executable

	$ spin -V
	Spin Version 3.1.2 -- 14 March 1998

test 1	check that you can run a simulation

	$ spin hello
	passed first test!
	1 processes created

test 2	a basic reachability check (safety)

	$ spin -a loops              # generate c-verifier
	$ cc -DNOREDUCE -o pan pan.c # no reduction (test)
	$ pan                        # default run
	hint: this search is more efficient if pan.c is compiled -DSAFETY

	Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
	8.338   equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
	7.061   actual memory usage for states (compression: 84.68%)
	        State-vector as stored = 165 byte + 4 byte overhead
	1.049   memory used for hash-table (-w18)
	0.200   memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
	8.417   total actual memory usage

	If compiled as above, the results should match the results from
	the table below. 
	The numbers in the first two columns of the table
	should match exactly.  (Note, the leader election algorithm
	that is in the current distribution was extended slightly
	compared to the one that was there before version 2.9.1)
	The numbers in the third column should match approximately
	(how well it matches depends only on the properties of
	the C-compiler and the speed of the hardware you use to
	run the tests.)
	The first line for each test is for the exhaustive run,
	the second line is for the reduced run.
	The times given are for an SGI system, with a 150 MHz 
	MIPS R4400 Cpu and 1 Gigabyte of main memory.

Note:
(1) perform this run as:  pan -m13000 -c0 -n
(2) if you have less than approx 100 Mb of main memory, the
    runtime for this test can increase considerably due to paging.
    (the verifier assumes a statespace that fits in memory)


test 7	check random number generator

	$ spin -p -g priorities		# will not terminate
	....
	3510:   proc  3 (A) line   5 "priorities" (state 3)  \
		[printf('%d\\n',_pid)]

	                a[1] = 116
	                a[2] = 234
	                a[3] = 344
	                a[4] = 474
	....

	Interrupt the run after it executes for a while.
	Note: the numbers in the array should tend to the ratio
	1:2:3:4 if the random number generator works properly.
	array index 0 remains unused (it's the pid of the init
	process)

test 8	test the generation of never claims from LTL formulae:

	$ spin -f "[] ( p U ( <> q ))"

	never {    /* [] ( p U ( <> q )) */
	T0_init:
	        if
	        :: ((p)) -> goto T0_init
	        :: (1) -> goto T0_S28
	        :: ((q)) -> goto accept_S14
	        fi;
	accept_S14:
	        if
	        :: (1) -> goto T0_S28
	        :: (((p) || (q))) -> goto T0_init
	        fi;
	accept_S28:
	        if
	        :: (1) -> goto T0_S28
	        :: ((q)) -> goto T0_init
	        fi;
	T0_S28:
	        if
	        :: ((q)) -> goto accept_S28
	        :: (1) -> goto T0_S28
	        :: ((q)) -> goto accept_S14
	        fi;
	accept_all:
	        skip
	}

test 9	read a never claim from a file (works only with 3.1.2 and later)

	$ spin -a -N leader.ltl leader	# the claim is in file leader.ltl
	$ cc -o pan pan.c		# the default compilation
	$ pan -a			# search for acceptance cycles
	warning: for p.o. reduction to be valid the never claim must be stutter-closed
