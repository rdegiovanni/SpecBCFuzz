-- Updated for SPIN Version 5.0 --- October 2007 ---

Perform tests test0 to test5 in the order listed, and
make sure you get the same results.
The next four tests are to assess the effect of
partial order reductions.  In exhaustive mode, they
may not all be executable within the bounds of your
system - with reduction turned on, though, they should
all run as specified.
The last test checks the use of execution priorities
during random simulations.

The file called 'pathfinder' illustrates the use of
'provided' clauses (using as inspiration the bug in
the control software of the Mars pathfinder that
spotted an otherwise perfect mission in July 1997)

	You can always check valid options of spin
	by typing (at command prompt $):
		$ spin --

	Similarly, you can check valid options of
	the compiled verifiers by typing:
		$ pan --

test 0	check that spin exists, is executable, and is
	the version that you expect

	$ spin -V
	Spin Version 5.0 -- 26 October 2007

test 1	check that you can run a simulation

	$ spin hello
		passed first test!
	1 process created

	or without the default indenting of output:

	$ spin -T hello
	passed first test!
	1 process created

test 2	a basic reachability check (safety)

	$ spin -a loops              # generate c-verifier
	$ cc -DNOREDUCE -o pan pan.c # no reduction (test)
	$ ./pan                        # default run
	hint: this search is more efficient if pan.c is compiled -DSAFETY

	If compiled as above, the results should match the results from the table below. 
	The numbers in the first two columns of the table should match precisely.  
	The numbers in the third column should match approximately (how well it matches
	depends only on the properties of the C-compiler and the speed of the hardware
	you use to run the tests.)
	The first line for each test is for the exhaustive run, the second line is for
	the default run using partial order reduction.
	The times given are for a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel PC, with 2 GB of memory.

	#processes: 5

	The numbers in the array should tend to the ratio
	1:2:3:4 if the random number generator works properly.
	array index 0 remains unused (it's the pid of the init
	process)

test 8	test the generation of never claims from LTL formulae:

	$ spin -f "[] ( p U ( <> q ))"

	never {    /* [] ( p U ( <> q )) */
	T0_init:
	        if

	$ cc -o pan pan.c		# the default compilation
	$ ./pan -a			# search for acceptance cycles
